Workshop 04 - Cody MacDonald

To start the program/impliment the loop I have used a do while loop. I chose
This loop will allow the code to infinity run as long as it does not meet the
condition I have designated, in this case 'x'. I needed the code in the while
loop to run once before checking if the condition was met as it was checking 
for user input. Hence the decision to use the do while loop over the while loop
which checks the condition first.

Secondly, I used a switch case statement to check the user input from the 'menu'.
I chose the switch statement as I only have one variable that needs to be checked,
with multiple values (cases). The default case was used to check if the user inputted
a none designated character and would give an error message. Another note is that I 
added a case with continue for the character 'x', the exit character, so that when x 
was inputted it would not reach the default case and print the error message.

To create the counting loops, I used a for loop as I can designate the number of times
I want the loop to run by setting an index and a condition linked to that index as well 
as how I want the index to increment. ie i++ increasing by 1 or i-- decreasing by 1.
