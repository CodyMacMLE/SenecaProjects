There are multiple reasons why pointers are not used in other coding languages yet being a powerful tool. 
One of the significant reasons I beleieve they are not used is due to the risks that come along with their power.
For instance, if a pointer is pointing to an address that has become deallocated it becomes a Dangling pointer.
That means if the program later reallocates that address with another variable we can expect unknown results, since that
variable can be accessed unbeknownst to the programmer from that dangling pointer. It is also possible to exceed the
allocated byte length of that address, hence if I have a character array of length 10, I can use the pointer to exceed that into
the next memory address that may be in use for another variable causing crashes. Pointers also can input values that are not of
the type of the orginal use of that variable. I can point to an address that has a int character type and I can input a float
which may cause unexpected results. All of these in combination can lead to security risks as "hackers" use these types of 
vulnerabilities to get code to act differently and access information that normally should not be accessed.
