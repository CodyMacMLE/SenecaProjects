Reflection 05 - Cody MacDonald

How would I allow the user to input a student id rather than an index 
within the editing or printing a student function?

Firstly, you could use another function to not over complicate the main 
function. This new function would take the "ID" input of the user and 
iterate through the BTP100.id member variable of the array with a for 
loop initiated at 0. An if statement would be nested inside to check if 
an exact match is found and breaks. The function should return the index 
that the loop was at which would equal the index of the array at the time 
it found the matching "ID". If it did not match in that iteration the for
loop would add one to the index variable and look in the next index of the array.

We can now use that new variable within the BTP100[variable] array to find the index.
