Question:
Can a computer really generate a random number? If so, explain how. 
If not, explain what computers can do instead to simulate randomness.

Answer:
A computer can not generate random numbers. To simulate randomness the computer uses
mathematical sequences to generate a pseudorandom number based off of a starting number(seed).
However, if the seed is defaulted or if we run the sequence with the same seed. We will recieve
the same sequence of "random numbers". Programmers work around this by iterating through seeds, 
or by using the datetime as a seed which is ever changing.
